# simple-draggable-component

- Create a simple React project
- Create <Box> components as you want.
- Create <Draggable> component making <Box> component draggable without an
  external library.

```
<Draggable>
	<Box />
</Draggable>
```

Make Draggable area cannot overflow current window. There is an additional score
with using TypeScript and writing unit test.
